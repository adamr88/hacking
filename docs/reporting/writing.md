# Writing

> I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead ~ Mark Twain

## Tone of Voice

The tone of voice should be casual, friendly and informative. It should not be authoritarian in nature. It should strive to target a broad audience of assumed intelligent and educated professionals who are simply unaware of certain practices. For further guidance, see the references section below

## How to Write Good

> The contrarian guide

1. Avoid alliteration. Always
2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with
3. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat)
4. Employ the vernacular
5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc
6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary
7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive
8. Contractions aren't necessary
9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos
10. One should never generalize
11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: "I hate quotations. Tell me what you know"
12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches
13. Don't be redundant; don't more use words than necessary; it's highly superfluous
14. Profanity sucks
15. Be more or less specific
16. Understatement is always best
17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement
18. One-word sentences? Eliminate
19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake
20. The passive voice is to be avoided
21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms
22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed
23. Who needs rhetorical questions?
